You know how the American Optometric Association recommends the 20-20-20 rule?
Every **20 minutes**, look at something **20 feet** away for **20 seconds**? 

This script sends a period reminder every 20 minutes. Run this at start up. Change the time if you want. Use it for another time interval. It's pretty barebones.
